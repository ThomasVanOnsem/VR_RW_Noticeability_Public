# Overview

This repository contains all the data and programs used during the thesis: 
"Open-World Virtual Reality: How noticeable is redirected walking?"


## Structure
As mentioned in the paper, 2 experiments were performed:
* Latency: In the paper we introduced latency awareness as one of our 
improvements to the redirected walking algorithms.
Code used to perform the latency experiments is located in the Latency folder.
* Noticeability: Contains code used to perform the noticeability experiments. (Includes the developed framework.)
